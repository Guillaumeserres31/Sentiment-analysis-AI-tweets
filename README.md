**Twitter Analysis on Generative AI Adoption**

**Overview**

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project investigating the public perception, trends, and impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) through Twitter data. Conducted as part of my Master's dissertation in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics at Toulouse Business School, this analysis provides insights into how individuals discuss and perceive generative AI technologies.

**Objective**

To analyze public sentiment toward generative AI on Twitter.

To identify key trends and events influencing tweet volumes and public interest.

To reveal the most discussed themes, sentiment distribution, and practical applications as reflected by tweets.

**Data Source**

56,221 tweets containing the hashtag #GenerativeAI collected between April 2022 and April 2023.

Variables analyzed include tweet ID, text content, timestamp, and usernames.

**Key Findings**

Rapid Increase in Interest: A significant rise in tweet volume occurred after the release of ChatGPT-3, with peaks correlating strongly with announcements of generative AI tools like Google's Bard and ChatGPT-4.

Predominantly Positive Sentiment: Majority of tweets were either positive (28,000) or neutral (23,000), indicating widespread acceptance and enthusiasm towards generative AI technologies.

Popularity of AI-Generated Art: Terms like "Stable Diffusion," "Midjourney," and appreciative language ("enjoyed," "great," "amazing") were highly prevalent, demonstrating public appreciation of AI-generated art despite ethical debates within professional artistic communities.

Emerging Business Themes: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) highlighted public discourse on the integration of generative AI into businesses, potential future applications, and strategic use cases in marketing and data science.

**Methodology**

Data Cleaning: Removal of duplicates, conversion to lowercase, removal of URLs, mentions, hashtags, and standard text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal).

Sentiment Analysis: Performed using the VADER sentiment analysis algorithm tailored for social media content.

Topic Modeling: Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract meaningful themes from tweet content.

Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear and insightful visual presentations.

**Tools and Technologies**

Python

NLTK, SpaCy (Text processing)

VADER (Sentiment analysis)

Scikit-learn (Topic modeling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

**Implications**

This analysis highlights the importance of generative AI as a transformative force in technology adoption, business innovation, and daily life practices. It provides businesses and recruiters with actionable insights into public perception and potential strategic applications of generative AI.
